## Introduction

Handwriting Recognition is an old ML problem that is still not completely solved because of its complexity. Once properly set up, It can be used to digitize different types of documents like historical texts, patient prescriptions, bank records, etc. In our project, we will be focussing on how we can utilize this technique to help society. We decided to create an application that will help visually impaired people listen to handwritten notes.

## Dataset 
[IAM](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/download-the-iam-handwriting-database)
    As dataset is huge, we have uploaded it to google drive. Google Colab will directly read from google drive. 
    The IAM Handwriting Database is hierarchically structured into forms (The name of the files correspond to the naming scheme of the LOB Corpus):
    Datas:
    data/ascii.tgz - Contains summarized meta information in ascii format.
    data/formsA-D.tgz data/formsE-H.tgz data/formsI-Z.tgz - Contains form images (example: a01-122.png).
    data/lines.tgz - Contains text lines (example: a01/a01-122/a01-122-02.png).
    data/sentences.tgz - Contains sentences, one for each line (example: a01/a01-122/a01-122-s01-02.png).
    data/words.tgz - Contains words (example: a01/a01-122/a01-122-s01-02.png).
    data/xml.tgz - Contains the meta-infornation in XML format (example: a01-122.xml).
